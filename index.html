    <h1>GREETINGS TO YOU!</h1>
    <p>As we go onto this journey, we have created ourselves a chatbot, that would promote the school's inquiry system, by recording its information by text messages and AI generation. 
      With the use of Voiceflow and other integrations to fully develop this into a customer service bot, it surely proves that people from Pasig Catholic College 
      can keep up with others who use AI for their educational cause.<br><br>And as we expect the chat experience, you will also seek the identity of our very own chatbot, PACICO, 
      that stands for Personal, Assistant, Companion, For Interaction, Counseling and Operation.Â This whole meaning of its name shows the capabilities it can have 
      throughout the exclusive features shown in the chatbox.<br><br>
      So what are you waiting for, try PACICO today!</p>
